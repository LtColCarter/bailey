                            		<p class="lead">"Space is big. Really big." But can computers change that? Computers have played a vital role in improving almost every aspect of space technology.</p>
                            	    <p>Without computers the space race wouldn't have seen as many advancements as it currently has. Computers help us in designing spacecrafts, simulating the working of the engine, planning the trajectory and velocity, finding faults or problems within the mission, and much more.</p>
                                    <p>Special computers are used to control rockets and fly them to their target orbit. They read sensor data and decide whether the sensors are properly functioning or faulty, and calculate the location, speed and direction of the rocket. Computers are also required to maintain contact between the spacecraft and the command centre. Some computers execute the final seconds of the launch countdown and make sure that all events happen at the right time.</p>
                                    <p>One example of how computers have helped in exploring space is NASA's rover, Curiosity, which landed on the surface of Mars to help determine whether Mars could have ever supported life. Sensor information is handled by using 'if, then and else' logic to help Curiosity navigate the unfamiliar environment. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43494227">It has made many remarkable observatons</a> and has helped scientists in studying the climate and geology of Mars.</p>
                                    <p>Another amazing feat is that <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-advanced-illustris-next-generation-computer-model-universe-simulations">the universe has been recreated in a massive computer simulation</a>. It's clear to see how greatly this helps us in further understanding the infinite reaches of space. Of course, the simulation is not without its anomalies, but it nevertheless will help us formulating hypotheses and testing theories.</p>
                                    <p>It is astounding to see how much space exploration has developed. Computers have made our world much smaller, enabling us to communicate with people on the other side of the globe. Will computers be able to do the same for space? Probably not in our lifetimes, but such a future might not just be a pipe dream.</p>
