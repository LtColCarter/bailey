                            		<p class="lead">Mobile phones, tablets, interactive whiteboards and virtual learning environments â€“ schools and universities are deploying more and more technology to improve students' learning.</p>
                            		<p>The basics of education haven't materially changed for a long time. Students are members of an educational establishment (school/college/university etc) which provides teachers (specialists in a subject area). These teachers try to impart knowledge to the students, according to a preset curriculum. Students are then usually assessed by undertaking final examinations which grant them qualifications that prove their competence.</p>
                                    <p>However, computers and similar devices may be starting to change that. Educational establishments are looking for new ways to engage students and bring greater interactivity to their lessons, as well as methods such as interactive quizzes to test students' understanding throughout their time in education. Some are even flipping learning entirely on its head by dispensing with the idea of a physical classroom altogether.</p>
                                    <p>Fully online courses mean that learners need not even live in the same country as their educational establishment. Such programmes exist for all ages, from elementary/primary school up to college/university level education. Students can join video conferences with teachers around the world.</p>
                                    <p>That being said, traditional physical classrooms also benefit from modern technologies. For example, the use of interactive whiteboards has skyrocketed in the past decade, with a paper from the University of Cambridge noting that British schools have rolled them out <a href="https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/iwb/AERA2006.pdf" target="_blank">"at a rate unprecedented anywhere else in the world"</a>. These devices allow students to engage with interactive content and slideshows in a way previously impossible.</p>
                                    <p>VLE (Virtual Learning Environment) software packages like Moodle&trade; and Blackboard&trade; are also becoming popular tools in the education sector. These allow students and teachers alike to login and access course material anytime, simply using a web browser. They also provide facilities for electronic submission and marking of classwork, as well as quizzes to test understanding.</p>
                                    <p>There are both proponents and opponents to the ever-increasing use of computers in education. Some question the as yet unproven use of technology as a total replacement for classroom learning, but others strongly feel that modern technologies can bring previously-unimaginable levels of collaboration, accessibility and interactivity to lessons. Overall however, most agree that technology can play a positive role in improving students' learning, when used in moderation.</p>
